- Loadout code is `dfl`.

### How it works
---
- Stabbing humanoids charges the blade and feeds it, reducing its overall hunger.
- If you start hearing whispers, you're not going insane. That's the blade being too hungry and draining your blood. Through blues. No, blues won't save you. The hungrier it gets, the faster you will lose blood. You cannot drop it once it starts feeding on you.
- Once the bar is full, you can stab yourself to activate the knife's powers. You will bleed, but also gain rapid health regeneration for 20 seconds. This will also feed the blade.
- You can "dry" stab yourself even if the knife isn't charged to feed it as a last ditch option if there are no humanoid enemies around. It gives it much more blood, but doesn't charge it, and the penalties are greater if you have blues.
- Equipping the knife while you have zerk makes spikes come out of the handle and impale your hand, locking it in place. For the duration of the zerk, you cannot deselect the weapon, nor can you drop it.
