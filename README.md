### Notes
---
- Loadout code is `dfl`.
- The bar on the HUD is the "charge" bar. The blade's hunger is not visibly tracked. The only cues to that are the whispers and suddent flinch when the knife begins to drain your blood. This occurs every two minutes once the process begins.
- Hunger and siphoned blood are tracked separately. How much blood is siphoned per attack depends on the damage. Same with hunger - the more damage you inflict, the more hunger you satiate.
- You can overfeed the blade. If overfed, more blood goes towards the siphoning.
- You can "dry" stab yourself even if the knife isn't charged to feed it as a last resort if there are no humanoid enemies around. It gives it much more blood, but doesn't charge it, and the penalties are greater if you have blues.
- Equipping the knife while you have zerk makes spikes come out of the handle and impale your hand, locking it in place. For the duration of the zerk, you cannot deselect the weapon, nor can you drop it.

### How it works
---
- Stabbing humanoids charges the blade and feeds it, reducing its overall hunger.
- Once the bar is full, you can stab yourself to activate the knife's powers. You will bleed, but also gain rapid health regeneration for 20 seconds. This will also feed the blade.
- The hungrier it gets, the faster you will lose blood. You cannot drop it once it starts feeding on you.
